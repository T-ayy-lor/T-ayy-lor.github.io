        <h2><a href="https://www.firefox.com/en-US/">Firefox</a></h2>
        <p>Firefox's inspector tools are an absolute must-have for smooth designing and developing.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">VS code's Live Server
                Extension</a></h2>
        <p>Not strictly necessary, but, provides the ability to auto refresh, allowing you to see changes as you make
            them.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a></h2>
        <p>MDN is considered the industry standard reference for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</a></h2>
        <p>W3schools is an excellent resource for referencing all aspects of web development.
            For almost every HTML element and every CSS property, W3schools has interactive examples,
            and thorough descriptions. </p>

        <h2><a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS-tricks</a></h2>
        <p>CSS-tricks is a site filled with various articles, guides, and examples for modern front-end design.
            It's a good place to scroll through from time-to-time, you might eye a cool styling technique that you'd
            like to implement.
        </p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/">Josh Comeau</a></h2>
        <p>Josh Comeau is a somewhat-famous but very esteemed front end developer, specializing in html/css/js, and
            provides several free bite-sized tutorials on his website!</p>
        <p>He even has a <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/effective-portfolio/">free book</a> on developing
            portfolio websites!</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?type=free">Front End Mentor</a></h2>
        <p>If you're struggling with inspiration, but still want to excercise your front end skills, front end mentor
            has many front end design challenges.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart">Github Pages</a></h2>
        <p>For deploying your website, I'd recommend Github Pages. It's free, and it gives you some github xp. Note, it
            only supports "static html", like what we've covered today. No backend.</p>
