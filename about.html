                Hello world, I've created this space to serve as a garden for all my interests.
                I'm largely inspired by techincal applications for artistic expression, and I'm hoping this platform will allow for such interests to grow and develop.
                I think it'll be a fun way to document all my endeavors, nonetheless.
                Since I've left social media, and for a multitude of associated reasons, I largely feel like a lone ranger both in the tech industry and online in general.
                So, this project is my love letter to what the web used to be, the wild west.
