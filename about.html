        <p>I created this space in hopes of carving out a slice of the web for myself in which I have complete and total freedom to display my work in the most accessible way possible.
            With that (and my growing paranoia), this website is my first step towards achieving technical independance.
            All too often online, convenience sacrifices privacy and limits self expression. I've come to realize that that doesn't have to be the case, not for me.
            And so, you can expect to find updates to this website with my various goings-ons as they happen!
