        <p>
            All too often online, convenience sacrifices privacy and limits self expression.
            With my growing distrust of the modern web, I wanted a space in which I can share my work and interests with the world while still maintaining technical independance.
            Having total control of my own space on the web allows me to tailor and display my projects in a way that's accessible to those who aren't technically proficient.
            Even though this medium can't match the exposure social media would get me, it provides a sense of fulfillment, nonetheless.
            It helps motivate me to continue to working, as having my finished projects just sitting in a github repository on my hard drive for nobody to see was beginning to feel.. uneventful.
            So, thanks for being here, internet stranger!
